# SQL_Data_warehouse_project
Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository 
This project showcases an end-to-end data warehousing and analytics workflow, starting from data ingestion and warehouse design to data transformation and insight generation.
Built as a portfolio project, it demonstrates practical implementation of data engineering and analytics concepts
while following industry best practices

# Project Overview

This project covers the full lifecycle of a modern data warehouse and analytics solution, including:
Data Architecture: Designing a scalable data warehouse using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers).
ETL Processes: Building pipelines to extract, transform, and load data from multiple source systems into the warehouse.
Data Modeling: Creating fact and dimension tables structured for efficient analytical querying.
Analytics & Reporting: Developing SQL-based analyses and reports to deliver meaningful business insights.

🔄 Data Processing & Quality Workflow

The diagram above represents the data processing workflow I followed throughout this project to ensure data accuracy, consistency, and reliability before analysis.

# Phase 1: Data Understanding

In this phase, the focus was on understanding the structure and meaning of the data:
Reviewing the data and its attributes
Desining the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)
Exploring relationships between tables
Identifying potential data quality issues early

# Phase 2: Data Quality Check

This phase ensures the data meets quality standards before transformation:
Checking primary key integrity (nulls and duplicates)
Detecting unwanted spaces and formatting issues
Validating data against defined business rules

# Phase 3: Data Processing & Transformation
Here, the data is cleaned, transformed, and standardized:
Data Cleaning: handling missing values, removing duplicates, trimming whitespace, and standardizing text cases
Data Transformation: applying business logic, filtering, grouping, and extracting required fields
Data Standardization: fixing invalid dates, validating numeric ranges, and unifying date formats

# Phase 4: Data Validation

The final step ensures data readiness for analytics:
Verifying data accuracy and completeness
Ensuring transformed data aligns with business expectations

✅ This structured process guarantees that the final datasets are clean, reliable, and analytics-ready, supporting accurate reporting and decision-making.
